%YAML 1.2 # Paws Rulebook

# Clearly, this file tests functionality that could screw up the tests themselves (meta, ain't it?)
# Thus, it's suggested that your implementation ‘group’ rules somehow (i.e. test suites), and only
# allow output to be printed for *one* group of rules at a time. This, or something similar, may be
# necessary to make sure that the rules that we're intentionally creating, and sometimes
# intentionally failing, inside these tests ... don't screw up your TAP output / conformance scores.
