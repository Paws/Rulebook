The Rulebook
============

One hopes this will eventually comprise a set of individual "specs" (in the [RubySpec][] style),
aiding newcomers in implementation and understanding of the [Paws][] environment.

Until then, it's a nice repository, containing exactly 438 bytes of beautiful UTF-8. Enjoy them.
